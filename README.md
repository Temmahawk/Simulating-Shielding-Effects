# Simulating-Shielding-Effects
Simulation Data of the Bachelor's Thesis: "Simulating Shielding Effects in Gamma Spectroscopy for Nuclear Warhead Confirmation"

This repository contains OpenMC simulation results in the form of 1950 x 1950 shielding matrices.
These matrices span phoon energies ranging from 50keV to 2MeV (from left to right: incoming photon energy, from top to bottom: outgoing photon energy).
The materials considered in these simulations include aluminum, barium, iridium, lead, platinum, rhenium, tin and tungsten.
